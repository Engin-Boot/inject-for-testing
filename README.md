# Inject for Testing

One of the exercises in the [Modularity Exercise](https://github.com/clean-code-craft-tcq-1/modular-colorcoder-cs) is to extend functionality. The new functionality is to print the color-code in the form of a reference manual.

The challenge is to write a unit-test for this functionality. The function prints a manual and doesn't return anything.

This repository illustrates an outline of dependency-injection to enable unit-testing of that functionality.
